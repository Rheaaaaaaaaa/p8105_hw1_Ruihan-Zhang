```{r setup}
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
plot = tibble(
  bill_length_mm = penguins$bill_length_mm,
  flipper_length_mm = penguins$flipper_length_mm,
)

ggplot(plot, aes(x=bill_length_mm, y=flipper_length_mm)) + geom_point(aes(color=penguins$species))

knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```
The important variables are species, island, bill_length_mm, bill_depth_mm, flipper_length_mm, body_mass_g, sex and year.
The size is `r nrow(penguins)` rows and `r ncol(penguins)` columns.
The mean flipper length is `r mean(penguins$flipper_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE)` mm.


This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
plot2 = tibble(
  norm = rnorm(10),
  logical = norm > 0,
  norm_a = as.character(norm),
  norm_c = factor(norm,3)
)  

#norm_c=factor(norm,3)

```
The mean of norm is `r mean(pull(plot2,norm))`.
The mean of logical is `r mean(pull(plot2,logical))`.
The mean of norm_a is `r mean(pull(plot2,norm_a))`.
The mean of norm_c is `r mean(pull(plot2,norm_c))`.
```{r eval = FALSE}
as.numeric(plot2$norm_a)
as.numeric(plot2$norm_c)
```
## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
